# Pacman AI Project

This repository contains a Python project that implements an AI agent for the classic game Pacman. The project combines the nostalgia of Pacman with the power of artificial intelligence algorithms to create an intelligent and challenging gaming experience.

## Project Overview

The Pacman AI project aims to develop an intelligent agent that can play Pacman autonomously and make strategic decisions to navigate the maze, collect food, avoid ghosts, and maximize the score. The project incorporates various AI techniques to enhance the agent's decision-making capabilities and gameplay.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

1. **Pacman Game**: The project provides the Pacman game implementation, including the maze, food pellets, ghosts, and Pacman's movements. The game follows the traditional Pacman rules and mechanics.

2. **AI Algorithms**: The project includes various AI algorithms that enable the Pacman agent to make intelligent decisions. These algorithms may include search algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search, A*), adversarial algorithms (e.g., minimax, alpha-beta pruning), reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA), or a combination of these techniques.

3. **Customization**: The project allows for customizing aspects of the game and AI behavior. This may include adjusting the difficulty level, modifying the game environment, adding new features, or experimenting with different AI algorithms.

4. **Visualization**: The project provides visualization capabilities to observe the AI agent's decision-making process. It may include visualizing search algorithms' exploration, tracking the agent's path, or displaying real-time statistics.

## Usage

To run the Pacman AI project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python3 and ensure it is properly configured on your system.

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

3. Install any required dependencies or libraries specified in the project's documentation.

4. Run the main game script, providing any necessary command-line arguments or configurations.

5. Interact with the game using the specified controls (e.g., arrow keys) or allow the AI agent to play autonomously.

6. Enjoy playing Pacman with AI!
